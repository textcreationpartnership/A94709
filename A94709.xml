         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat if the many ſold Services, and extreame Sufferings, of Lieutenant Colonell <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> in opoſition
to Tyrany, and Oppreſſion, and how inſtrumentall he hath been in the removall of divers ſorts of oppreſſiors, his
wonderfull Deliverances and clear acquitments by legall Tryalls, from all former accuſations, without the
leaſt ſtayne to his reputation, if all theſe could be forgotten, and that he ſtood in our thoughts, but as the
meaneſt of well affected perſons, (and ſuch at the leaſt we muſt allow him, having in all times adhered to
Parliaments) yet in your late proceedings towards him, and heavy cenſure upon him, wee aprehend our
native rights ſo much concerned that wee never conceived a greater cauſe of ſpeedy application to you, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
then upon this ſad occaſion.</p>
            <p>For certainly, it cannot be denied, but if he be really an offender, he is ſuch by the breach of ſome law, made and publiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fact, and ought by due proceſſe of Law, and verdict of twelve men to be thereof convict, and found guilty of ſuch
Crime, unto which the Law alſo hath preſcribed ſuch a puniſhment agreeable to that our fundamentall Liberty, which enjoyneth,
that no freeman of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be adjudged of Life, Limbe, Liberty, or Eſtate but by Juries; a fredome which Parliaments in
all ages Contended to preſerve from violation as the Birthright, and Chief inheritance of the People, as may appeare moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably
in the Petition of Right, which you have ſtiled that moſt excellent Law.</p>
            <p>And therefore we truſt upon ſecond thoughts (being the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi>) you will be ſo far from bereaving us, (who have
never forfeited our rights) of this our native right, and way of Tryalls by Juryes, (for what is done unto any one may be done unto
every one) that you will preſerve them entire to us, and to poſterity, from the encroachments of any, that would inovate upon them.</p>
            <p>And if the originall of the unhapy differences betweene Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> be duly weighed (being as wee are
informed) it will appear, that Sr. <hi>Arthurs</hi> ſtoppage of monies due to Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> without Legall proceſs, was the firſt occaſion thereof.</p>
            <p>And it is believed, that if Mr. <hi>Primats</hi> cauſe, (wherein Sr. <hi>Arthur,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> have been ingaged: had at any time either
at firſt or laſt been admitted to a Tryall at law, and had paſſed any way by verdict of twelve ſworne men; all the trouble and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencs
ariſing thereupon had been prevented: the way of determination by Major votes of Committees, being neither ſo certaine
nor ſo ſatisfactory in any caſe as by way of Juries, the benefit of Challenges and Exceptiones, and unanimous Conſent, being all
eſſentiall Priveledges in the latter: whereas Committees' are tyed to noe ſuch rules, but are at liberty to be preſent or abſent at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
beſides Juries being birthright, and the other but new and temporary, men doe not, nor as (wee humbly conceive ever will)
acquieſſe in the one as on the other from whence, it is not all together ſo much to be wondered at, if upon diſſatisfactions, there
have been ſuch frequent printing of mens caſes, and dealings of Committees, as there have been, and ſuch harſh and inordinate
heats, and expreſſions between partyes intereſted, ſuch ſudden and importunate appeales to your Authority, being indeed all alike
out of the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> roade, and leading into nothing but trouble and perplexity, breeding hatred and enmityes betweene worthy
families, affronts and diſguſte betweene perſons of the ſame publique affection and intereſt, and to the rejoycing of none but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
adverſaryes, all which and many more inconveniencies can only be avoyded, by referring all ſuch caſes to the uſuall tryalls and
finall determination of law</p>
            <p>And whereas you have conſured Mr. <hi>Lilburne 7000 l.</hi> fine, and to perpetual Paniſhment, and to dye as a fellon if he return, we
are excedingly afflicted in our ſpirits thereby, not onely becauſe he hath not had the uſuall way of tryall by Jury which yet weighs
very much with us, nor for that we beleeve he hath followed Mr. <hi>Primats</hi> cauſe out of ſtrong perſwaſion of the juſtneſſe thereof, (the
Cauſe in it ſelfe as we have been informed being very intricate and hard to be underſtood, &amp; ſo did not willfully or intentionally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it on againſt his Conſcience ſome of the Commiſſioners wiſhing to God it had therefore never came before them, nor for that we
believe him innocent of any wilfull breach of Parliament priviledge, in delivering printed Petitions, before the original was preſented
unto you, that being never before publiſhed, to be a breach, though all theſe adde to our grief, yet the main or our affliction ariſeth
from the deſtructiveneſſe of the Sentence, and as being therein contrary to that other our fundamentall native right, which injoyns that
Fines ſhould have regard to the qualities of the perſons: a plowman ſaving his wainage, and a merchant his merchandiſe, whereas this if
relating to his eſtate, we believe is ſo farre from preſerving him in his quality, as that it leaves himſelf, his wife and children without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance,
if in relation to his perſon, his affection to Parliaments, and zeal to publick freedome, renders all forreign Nations ſo unſafe
to him, as that in effect he is baniſhed into a Wilderneſſe, and expoſed naked to the fury of bears and lions.</p>
            <p>The premiſes duly weighed, and for that (as we are informed) the parties accuſed and cenſured, have had no means to ſee what
report hath been made by the Honorable Committee, nor have had the liberty of exceptions thereunto, in like Caſes granted, and
in that many well affected people that heard the Debates, and Evidences on both ſides, are unſatisfied both in point of poſſeſſion, and
title to rhe Collary in queſtion, that the honor of Parliament may ſtand immaculate, our native fundamentall rights inviolable, and
all thoſe Gentlemen concerned in this Cauſe left, without any the leaſt grudging, or juſt complaint.</p>
            <div type="items">
               <head>We have deemed our ſelves bound in Conſcience in moſt humble manner to intreat</head>
               <p>I. That you will be pleaſed to recall your forementioned grievous Sentence upon Lieutenant Col. <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> and the reſt
concerned therein.</p>
               <p>II. To give free liberty to Mr <hi>Primate</hi> to proſecute his Cuaſe, both for Title, and poſſeſſion at the Common Law, and therein
to make uſe of what counſell he ſhall think fit.</p>
               <p>III. That Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig</hi> be referred to take his courſe at Law, for whatſoever injuries conceived to be done unto him by
Lieutenant Col. <hi>John Lilburn</hi> or any others, as was granted in Mr. <hi>Muſgraves</hi> Caſe with the ſaid Sir <hi>Arthur,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi>
or any others may have the ſame liberty againſt Sir <hi>Arthur,</hi> if they conceive any cauſe.</p>
               <p>IV. That you will appoint ſome ſpeedy courſe for the receiving and anſwering of Petitions, that ſo men through long atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
be not enforced unto wayes diſpleaſing or inconvenient.</p>
               <p>V. That you will very tenderly regain, and maintain every one of our fundamentall Native rights, as you would the very being
and juſt conſtitution of Parliaments, that being a principall part of our Native rights.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That you will be pleaſed to conceive rightly of this our humble application to you at this time upon this weighty occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to admit no harſh conſtruction, or ſiniſter ſuggeſtion thereupon, but to believe that in the ſincerity of our conſciences, we
have aimed onely herein at the glory of God, the honour, peace, and ſafety of Parliament and Common-wealth. And if by your
favourable acceptance we ſhall be made any wayes inſtrumentall to thoſe juſt ends, it ſhall diſſolve us into true thankfulneſſe, And
